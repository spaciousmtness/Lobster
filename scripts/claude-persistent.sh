# Lobster Persistent Claude Session
#
# Replaces the old claude-wrapper.sh (polling --print mode) with a persistent
# Claude session that stays alive, using wait_for_messages() to block between
# message batches.
#
# Lifecycle state machine:
#   STOPPED    -> no Claude process
#   STARTING   -> this script is launching Claude
#   WAITING    -> Claude is blocked on wait_for_messages() (primary state)
#   PROCESSING -> Claude is handling a message batch
#   DELEGATING -> Claude spawned a subagent for substantial work
#   HIBERNATING -> Claude exited cleanly, wrote state to handoff doc
#
# Key design changes from claude-wrapper.sh:
#   - Claude runs persistently (not one-shot --print per batch)
#   - Uses --resume to maintain context across restarts
#   - State file tracks lifecycle phase for health check coordination
#   - Clean hibernation support: Claude can exit and write state
#   - Outer loop only restarts on abnormal exit, not routine lifecycle
#
# The systemd service should run this script directly.
#===============================================================================

# Note: not using set -e because we handle exit codes explicitly

# =============================================================================
# CRITICAL: Sanitize Claude Code environment variables IMMEDIATELY at script
# entry, before anything else runs. Claude Code sets CLAUDECODE=1 and
# CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT in its own process. These leak when:
#   1. An SSH user runs Claude Code, which sets these in the shell
#   2. That shell (or systemd) launches tmux, which inherits the vars
#   3. The tmux server passes them to all new panes/windows
#   4. claude binary inside tmux sees CLAUDECODE=1 and refuses to start
#
# This MUST happen at script top level (not inside a function) so the vars
# are stripped from this process's environment before tmux inherits them.
# The launch_claude() function also strips them from tmux's global env as
# a second layer of defense.

#   When the systemd ExecStop fails (e.g. tmux server already dead), the
#   `claude` and `bash` child processes from the previous session can linger

#
# Safety contract:
#   - Only kills processes matching "claude.*--dangerously-skip-permissions"
#   - Walks up to 8 ancestor levels to check lineage
#   - Any process whose ancestor chain reaches a current tmux pane PID is
#     considered "ours" and is left alone
#   - Processes adopted by PID 1 (init) are always considered orphans
#   - SIGTERM first, SIGKILL only after a 3-second grace period
#   - SIGKILL is only sent to PIDs that previously received SIGTERM (not the
#     full original list), preventing accidental kills due to PID reuse

        # #2060). RestartSec=0 masked the user-visible impact of the restart

        # the same cgroup membership from when it was forked) resolves to
