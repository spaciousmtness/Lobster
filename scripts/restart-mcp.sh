# restart-mcp.sh — Safe wrapper for restarting the lobster-mcp service.
#
# USE THIS SCRIPT instead of calling `sudo systemctl restart lobster-mcp`
# directly.  Direct restarts invalidate the active MCP session immediately,
# leaving the dispatcher blocked in wait_for_messages with a "Session not found"
# error and no recovery guidance.
#
# This script:
#   1. Writes an mcp-restart warning message to ~/messages/inbox/
#   2. Waits 2 seconds for the dispatcher to process it
#   3. Runs `sudo systemctl restart lobster-mcp`
#
# The inbox message tells the dispatcher the restart is intentional and that
# it should re-orient after reconnecting.  Combined with Fix 1
# (session-lost-reminder written on server startup), the dispatcher has two
# chances to see recovery guidance.
#
# Usage:
#   ~/lobster/scripts/restart-mcp.sh
#   ~/lobster/scripts/restart-mcp.sh --no-wait   (skip 2s delay, for scripted use)

# Write the warning message to the inbox. NOTE: "subtype" (not "type") is

# _inbox_priority() — _INBOX_P0_TYPES is empty, only _INBOX_P0_SUBTYPES is
# checked. This was missing here until issue #2275's review caught the same
# bug freshly copied into scripts/upgrade.sh; fixed in both at once.
# The subtype is "session-restart", not "compact-reminder" (issue #2279): a
# restart warning is not a compaction, and tagging it as one made the
# dispatcher run its compaction handler (catchup subagents) for no reason.
