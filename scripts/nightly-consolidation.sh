# Nightly Consolidation - Cron wrapper script
#
# Injects a consolidation task message into the inbox for the running
# Claude session to process. Claude handles the actual synthesis using
# its MCP memory tools (memory_recent, mark_consolidated, etc.).
#
# No direct API calls are made here. Everything goes through Claude Code.
#
# Crontab entry:
#   2 3 * * * $HOME/lobster/scripts/nightly-consolidation.sh >> $HOME/lobster-workspace/logs/nightly-consolidation.log 2>&1
#
# Runs at 03:02 (not 03:00) to avoid a race with the health check that fires at
# 03:00. If consolidation fires at 03:00, the dispatcher's WFM loop wakes, writes
# an "exited" tombstone to wfm_active, and the health check (also at 03:00)
# catches it in that WAKING_UP gap — seeing stale heartbeat + exited tombstone
# and concluding the dispatcher is dead. Staggering to 03:02 ensures the health
# check always reads the dispatcher solidly in WFM (GREEN). See issue #2074.
#
# Dedup guard: if a consolidation message is already pending in the inbox,
# this script exits without writing a duplicate.
