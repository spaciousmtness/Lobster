# Lobster Health Check v3 - Lifecycle-Aware, Deterministic Monitoring
#
# Design principles:
#   - Zero LLM dependency: no heartbeat, no tmux scraping, no MCP checks
#   - Lifecycle-aware: reads lobster-state.json to understand current phase
#   - Single observable truth: is the inbox draining?
#   - Recovery via systemd: never manually rebuild tmux sessions
#   - Direct Telegram alerts: curl, not outbox (outbox may be broken too)
#   - Low noise: only alert on genuine problems, not routine transitions
#
# Lifecycle states (from claude-persistent.sh):
#   active     - Claude is running (WAITING on wait_for_messages or PROCESSING)
#   starting   - Wrapper is launching Claude (transient, < 30s)
#   restarting - Wrapper is restarting after an exit (transient, < 60s)
#   hibernate  - DEPRECATED: dispatcher no longer writes this state (PR #1447).
#                If seen in a stale state file, treated as active (full checks apply).
#   backoff    - Wrapper hit rapid-restart limit, cooling down
#   stopped    - Wrapper received signal, shutting down
#   waking     - Wrapper detected messages, about to launch Claude
#
# Compaction suppression (inbox drain only):
#   When Claude Code compacts its context, tool calls pause for 1-3+ minutes.
#   During this window real user messages can age past STALE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS
#   and trigger a false-positive restart. To prevent this, on-compact.py writes
#   a compacted_at timestamp to lobster-state.json, and the stale-inbox check
#   is skipped for COMPACTION_SUPPRESS_SECONDS after that timestamp.
#   NOTE: Dispatcher liveness check (check_dispatcher_heartbeat) is NOT
#   suppressed during compaction — the 20-minute threshold covers it naturally.
#
# Dispatcher liveness (replaces WFM freshness + catchup suppression):
#   hooks/thinking-heartbeat.py writes a Unix epoch timestamp to
#   ~/lobster-workspace/logs/dispatcher-heartbeat on every PostToolUse event.
#   check_dispatcher_heartbeat() reads this single file and checks its age.
#   The 1200s threshold covers compaction, catchup, and boot without any
#   suppression logic. The dispatcher no longer needs to call
#   record-catchup-state.sh to suppress false alarms. See issue #1483.
#
#   WFM-active suppression: while the dispatcher blocks in wait_for_messages on
#   an idle inbox, the WFM daemon thread refreshes DISPATCHER_WFM_ACTIVE_FILE
#   every 60s. A fresh WFM-active file (< 180s) suppresses the heartbeat-stale RED.
#   CRITICAL (issue #2074): suppression is time-bounded at WFM_SUPPRESSION_MAX_SECONDS.
#   A frozen dispatcher's daemon thread keeps refreshing WFM-active independently
#   of the asyncio loop — unbounded suppression recreates the false-negative that
#   caused the May 2026 2-day outage. Once the heartbeat has been stale that long,
#   RED fires regardless of WFM-active freshness.
#
#   WFM_SUPPRESSION_MAX_SECONDS is DERIVED from SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS (see
#   below), not a fixed literal — see the derivation comment near that constant
#   for why a fixed 2700s cap caused an hourly false-positive restart loop on
#   2026-08-03 once wait_for_messages was allowed to legitimately idle for hours
#   (issue #2074, second incident).
#
# Boot grace period:
#   After any restart (health-check-initiated or manual), the new Claude session
#   needs ~60-90s to initialize and begin draining the inbox. During this window
#   the health-check skips stale-inbox and process/tmux checks to avoid
#   false-positive restarts. The boot timestamp is written to lobster-state.json
#   as booted_at by claude-persistent.sh (on first start) and by do_restart()
#   (after each health-check-initiated restart). Resource checks (memory, disk,
#   auth, outbox) still run during the grace period.
#   NOTE: Dispatcher heartbeat check is NOT suppressed during boot grace — the
#   20-minute threshold absorbs the 90s boot window naturally.
#
# Escalation ladder:
#   GREEN  - All checks pass (or in expected transient state)
#   YELLOW - Inbox messages exist < STALE threshold, or transient state
#   RED    - Stale inbox > threshold OR missing process/tmux/service -> restart
#   BLACK  - 3 restart failures in cooldown window -> alert, stop retrying
#
# Run via cron every 4 minutes:
#   */4 * * * * $HOME/lobster/scripts/health-check-v3.sh

# Session age limit: proactive SIGTERM restart mechanism (issue #2059).
#
# DISABLED BY DEFAULT (issue #2196 / #2157). This mechanism was originally
# justified by a claimed "CC enforces a hard 7440s session lifetime" — but
# issue #2157 found that claim rested on only 2 data points, was never
# confirmed against Anthropic docs, and had a more likely alternative
# explanation (an unrelated heartbeat-staleness bug, since fixed by #2074).
# The live dispatcher session has since run 90+ hours with zero problems,
# directly contradicting the original 7440s premise. There is no remaining
# evidence that Claude Code kills sessions on a wall-clock timer.
#
# The mechanism itself still works and is harmless once opted into: when
# enabled, it sends a graceful SIGTERM to the dispatcher PID at
# SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS so the Stop hook fires cleanly (vs. an
# uncontrolled kill from some other layer, e.g. a systemd bounce). Keep it
# available as an opt-in operational precaution — e.g. an operator who wants
# a periodic recycle for unrelated reasons (log rotation, memory hygiene) —
# but do not force it on new/updated installs by default.
#
# Written by inject-bootup-context.py as a plain Unix epoch integer.

#
# CRITICAL TIME CAP (issue #2074): A frozen dispatcher's WFM daemon thread
# continues to refresh DISPATCHER_WFM_ACTIVE_FILE every 60s independently of the
# main asyncio event loop — so WFM-active freshness alone is NOT sufficient proof
# of liveness. The suppression is therefore time-bounded:
#
#   If the dispatcher heartbeat has been stale for >= WFM_SUPPRESSION_MAX_SECONDS,
#   the WFM-active freshness check is ignored and RED fires regardless.
#
# --- Why this is derived, not a fixed literal (issue #2074, second incident) ---
# The original fix (PR #2090) hardcoded WFM_SUPPRESSION_MAX_SECONDS=2700 (45 min).
# That assumed a legitimate wait_for_messages() idle window would never get
# anywhere near 45 minutes, because Claude Code's own client-side MCP tool-idle
# watchdog used to abort wait_for_messages well under that window. PR #2144
# (2026-08-02) removed that client-side watchdog *by design*, so wait_for_messages
# can now legitimately block for hours on a quiet inbox. That silently invalidated
# the 2700s assumption: any normal quiet period longer than 45 minutes started
# un-suppressing this check and firing a false RED, restarting a perfectly healthy
# dispatcher roughly hourly (observed 2026-08-03).
#
# check_session_age() already provides an unconditional, activity-independent
# backstop: every dispatcher session is recycled at SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS
# regardless of heartbeat or WFM state (it sends SIGTERM directly to the
# dispatcher PID on a wall-clock timer, not a heartbeat-derived one). So this cap
# no longer needs to be a fast, independent frozen-detector — it only needs to
# catch the case where that backstop itself failed to fire (e.g. a missing or
# corrupt dispatcher.pid file). Deriving it as (SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS minus a
# safety margin) keeps it just inside that backstop, so it can never again be
# tighter than the session lifetime a legitimate idle wait is allowed to reach.
# See compute_wfm_suppression_max_seconds() below.
WFM_SUPPRESSION_MARGIN_SECONDS=300      # 5 min: fire slightly before the session-age backstop would anyway

# --- The no-backstop fallback (SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS=0) ---
# When the session-age check is disabled (the default as of issue #2196) there is
# NO unconditional restart event for this cap to "fire slightly before". So the
# fallback must do the opposite of the derived branch above: instead of sitting
# just *inside* a backstop, it must sit comfortably *outside* the longest idle
# wait a healthy dispatcher can legitimately produce.
#
# That longest legitimate wait is wait_for_messages()'s own default timeout
# (see `"default": 72000` for the timeout arg in src/mcp/inbox_server.py). On a
# fully quiet night with zero messages the dispatcher blocks for the whole
# 72000s and its heartbeat stays stale that entire time — entirely healthy. Any
# fallback BELOW 72000s therefore guarantees exactly one false-positive restart
# per maximal quiet stretch (the bug fixed here: 70200s fired 30 min early).
#
# Per docs/engineering-lessons-learned.md ("Independent Timing Constants That
# Encode a Shared, Unstated Assumption"), the fallback is DERIVED from the
# wait_for_messages timeout it depends on rather than hand-copied as a literal,
# so the relationship is visible at the point of definition and the margin is
# added in the direction the branch actually needs.

# Pure function: derive the WFM-active suppression cap from the session-age

# to DISPATCHER_HEARTBEAT_FILE within the last DISPATCHER_HEARTBEAT_STALE_SECONDS.
# The hook fires on every PostToolUse event — any tool call resets the clock.
#
# This single-file check replaces the previous multi-signal approach
# (claude-heartbeat file + last_processed_at + last_thinking_at in
# lobster-state.json). The 20-minute threshold naturally covers:
#   - Context compaction pause (1-3 minutes with no tool calls)
#   - Startup catchup subagent (up to 10-12 minutes)
#   - Boot grace period (60-90 seconds)
#
# No suppression logic needed — the threshold does the work.
#
# Gracefully skips the check if the heartbeat file does not exist (fresh install
# or first run before the hook has fired).

# Session Age Check — opt-in proactive restart on a wall-clock timer
# (issue #2059; disabled by default as of issue #2196 — see #2157)
#
# Originally justified by a claimed hard 7440-second CC session lifetime.
# That claim is debunked: issue #2157 found the original evidence (issue
# #2059) rested on only 2 data points, was never confirmed against Anthropic
# docs, and had a more likely alternative explanation (an unrelated
# heartbeat-staleness bug, fixed by #2074). The live dispatcher session has
# since run 90+ hours with zero problems, directly contradicting the
# original premise. There is no remaining evidence CC kills sessions on a
# wall-clock timer, so this is DISABLED BY DEFAULT (SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS=0).
#
# When enabled (LOBSTER_SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS set to a positive value in
# config.env), this sends SIGTERM to the dispatcher process once the session
# reaches SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS, so the Stop hook fires cleanly instead
# of an uncontrolled kill from some other layer. Unlike do_restart() (which
# uses systemctl), this sends SIGTERM directly to the claude process so the
# Stop hook fires. The claude-persistent.sh wrapper detects the exit and
# restarts Claude automatically.
#
# Suppressed when:
#   - SESSION_AGE_LIMIT_SECONDS=0 (the default — check is disabled entirely)
#   - DISPATCHER_SESSION_START_FILE is missing (old install, no session tracking)
#   - Maintenance mode is active (flag is present — handled in main before this call)
#   - Boot grace period is active (avoid killing a session that just started)
#
# Returns:
#   0 — session age is within limit (or no data)
#   1 — SIGTERM sent (graceful proactive restart initiated)

# kill_dispatcher_children — signal descendant processes of the dispatcher
# (issue #2119, hardened for #2221)
#
# Why not signal the dispatcher's whole process group instead (kill -TERM
# -$pgid)? That was the initial fix proposal, but it does not hold up against
# the live process tree. Verified on the production host, both at #2119 fix
# time and re-verified for #2221 (still holds -- same PGID sharing today):
#
#   $ ps -o pid,ppid,pgid,sid,comm -p "$dispatcher_pid"
#       PID    PPID    PGID     SID COMMAND
#   4183042 2901787 2901787 2901787 claude
#
# The dispatcher's PGID (2901787) is NOT its own PID (4183042) -- it shares
# its process group with claude-persistent.sh (PID 2901787), the supervisor
# script that detects the dispatcher's exit and relaunches it, which in turn
# runs under the tmux session leader. `kill -TERM -$dispatcher_pid` would
# target a process group that doesn't exist (no-op); using the *real* PGID
# instead would SIGTERM the supervisor and the tmux pane along with it,
# breaking the auto-restart mechanism this entire flow depends on. This also
# rules out PGID as the fix for #2221: every obsidian-mcp descendant (the
# `npm exec` wrapper, the `sh -c` it forks, and the `node` worker under that)
# shares that same PGID with the supervisor, so group-signalling still is not
# a safe way to isolate "the dispatcher's descendants" from "the supervisor
# that must survive the restart."
#
# Enumerating the FULL descendant tree of $dispatcher_pid (get_descendant_pids,
# a recursive walk -- see #2221) is the safe alternative: it reaches every MCP
# descendant the dispatcher spawned at every hop (obsidian-mcp's `npm exec` ->
# `sh -c` -> `node` chain, inbox_server.py, etc.) without touching anything
# above the dispatcher in the process tree. A one-hop `pgrep -P` (the #2119
# implementation) only found the immediate child (`npm exec`); it did not
# reach the `sh`/`node` descendants underneath, which is exactly the gap
# #2221 closes. A fresh set of children is spawned by the next Claude launch
# regardless, so killing all current descendants here is safe -- none of them
# have a reason to outlive this session.
#
# Takes the descendant PIDs as arguments (already-enumerated by the caller)
# rather than a parent PID to enumerate itself. This matters: the caller must
# snapshot the descendants BEFORE sending SIGTERM to the dispatcher, because
# once the dispatcher exits its children are reparented away immediately —
# enumerating *after* the SIGTERM is a race that can observe zero descendants
# even though they existed a moment earlier.
