"""
Context-compaction hook for Lobster.

Fires on SessionStart — registered with matcher="" so it fires on every
session start.  The script self-gates using _is_compact_event(): it checks the
``source`` field in the CC SessionStart payload (primary) and ``hook_name`` as
a fallback, then exits immediately for non-compact events.

Injects a system message into the Lobster inbox so that the next call to
wait_for_messages() surfaces a reminder to re-read CLAUDE.md and re-orient
from handoff/memory context.

The script is idempotent: if a compact-reminder message already exists in
inbox/ or processing/ it skips writing a duplicate.

Compaction detection (self-gate):
  Tier 1:  data["source"] == "compact"  (CC-documented field)
  Tier 2:  data["hook_name"] == "compact"  (observed in some CC versions)
  Tier 3:  dispatcher-wfm-active file contains a digit-only timestamp
           (filesystem fallback for CC versions that omit both fields)
  If none of the tiers match, the script exits immediately (sys.exit(0)).

Notification: always writes a compaction notification to ~/messages/outbox/
(the Lobster outbox pipeline) so the user is notified via Telegram.  The
outbox watcher picks up the file and delivers it to the correct transport.
This matches the architectural pattern used by all other Lobster notifications
and avoids direct Telegram API calls from the hook.

State: always writes compacted_at to lobster-state.json so that the health
check can suppress stale-inbox false-positives during the compaction pause.
Also writes last_compaction_ts to compaction-state.json so that the catch-up
subagent knows which window of history to recover after compaction.

Dispatcher-only: exits immediately for subagent sessions (detected via
_is_dispatcher_compact(), which extends session_role.is_dispatcher() with a
LOBSTER_MAIN_SESSION + stored-JSONL fallback).  Subagent compactions must not
write compact-reminders or the sentinel — those signals are only meaningful to
the dispatcher.

Compaction session_id change: CC assigns a NEW session_id to the post-compact
session, so the hook input's session_id won't match the stored
dispatcher-session-id marker even for the dispatcher's own compaction.
_is_dispatcher_compact() handles this by checking LOBSTER_MAIN_SESSION=1 +
whether the previous dispatcher session JSONL still exists on disk.

    When LOBSTER_DEBUG=true, writes a plain-text prompt asking the dispatcher
    to reflect on the bootup/compaction experience and file GitHub issues with
    observations. The dispatcher reads and deletes this file directly at
    startup (one `Read` call -- see sys.dispatcher.bootup.md step 2e) instead
    of the prompt flowing through the inbox as a regular message. This
    eliminates the 2 MCP round-trips per restart (`mark_processing` +
    `mark_processed`) the inbox path required (issue #1998).

    Overwrites any previous sidecar file unconditionally: at most one bootup
    prompt is ever meaningful at a time (the dispatcher consumes and deletes it
    on every startup before the next one could be written), so last-writer-wins
    is correct here -- no ID-based dedup bookkeeping is needed, unlike the old
    inbox-message path.

    Silent on any failure — must never crash the hook.
