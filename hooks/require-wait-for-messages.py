Stop hook: block the dispatcher from ending a turn without calling wait_for_messages.

The dispatcher's main loop is: process messages → call wait_for_messages →
repeat. When the dispatcher stalls — typically after processing a batch of
subagent results or system messages — it can end a turn without calling
wait_for_messages. The health check catches this after ~12 minutes and
restarts, causing ~30s of missed messages per incident.

This hook fires on every Stop event (dispatcher or subagent). Subagent
sessions are immediately exempted via the agent_id fast path (see "Dispatcher
detection" below). For the dispatcher, the hook scans the transcript: if
wait_for_messages was not called, it exits 2 (blocking) so the dispatcher
MUST call wait_for_messages before the turn ends.

## Dispatcher detection (agent_id fast path — issue #2218)

This hook used to call session_role.is_dispatcher(), which reads a one-shot
startup flag file that inject-bootup-context.py deletes immediately after
SessionStart, by design. Because every dispatcher Stop event fires long after
that deletion, is_dispatcher() always returned False for the dispatcher's own
Stop events — meaning "only enforce for the dispatcher session" silently
exempted the dispatcher from this check for the entire session, disabling the
anti-stall protection this hook exists to provide (the dispatcher could end a
turn without calling wait_for_messages and this hook would never block it).

Fixed by switching to the agent_id fast path: Claude Code injects agent_id
only into subagent hook payloads, never into the dispatcher's own Stop
payloads — no persisted state required, valid for the dispatcher's entire
session lifetime. Same pattern used by dispatcher-state-stop.py,
thinking-heartbeat.py, catchup-gate.py, post-compact-gate.py, and
require-write-result.py (fixed together for issue #2218).

## Why blocking (exit 2) instead of warn-only (exit 0)

The warn-only version (PR #815) printed to stderr but Claude proceeded with
the turn ending anyway — 3 restarts occurred tonight after that PR merged.
The warning fires after the turn is already ending; Claude has no chance to
act on it in the same turn. Exit 2 injects the error message as a system
turn and Claude gets a new turn where it must call wait_for_messages before
stopping again.

This mirrors how require-write-result.py handles subagents: hard-block until
the required tool is called.

## Transcript handling

Stop hooks in CC 2.1.76+ pass a file path (transcript_path) rather than an
inline transcript list. Both the file-based and legacy inline forms are tried
so the hook works across CC versions.

Each line of the JSONL transcript file has the structure:
    {"type": "assistant", "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": [...]}, ...}

Tool use items are nested under entry["message"]["content"], not entry["content"].
_collect_tool_names() handles both JSONL and legacy inline formats.

## Suppressing feedback injection on success

Claude Code injects a "Stop hook feedback: ... No stderr output" system message
even when the hook exits 0. To prevent this from triggering a new turn,
the hook outputs JSON with {"suppressOutput": true} on all success paths.

## Graceful exit bypass

Two legitimate cases require the dispatcher to exit without calling
wait_for_messages again:

1. **Hibernation**: wait_for_messages(hibernate_on_timeout=True) returned a
   message containing "Hibernating" or "EXIT" — the dispatcher must exit. Calling
   WFM again would be wrong.
2. **Context restart**: After writing the handoff and calling `lobster restart`,
   the dispatcher should exit. It already called WFM earlier in the same session;
   forcing another call would cause a loop.

In these cases, the dispatcher writes an empty file at /tmp/lobster-graceful-exit
immediately before exiting. The hook checks for this file: if present, it deletes
the file and exits 0 (allowing the turn to end). The file is consumed on first use.

The block message itself documents this bypass mechanism so the dispatcher can act
on it without consulting external docs.

## Exemptions

The hook does NOT fire for:
- Sessions without LOBSTER_MAIN_SESSION=1 (non-Lobster Claude Code sessions)
- Subagent sessions (agent_id present in hook_input)
- Any session where wait_for_messages was called at least once in the transcript
- Transcript read failures (I/O error → allow stop rather than false-positive block)
- Graceful exit bypass: /tmp/lobster-graceful-exit file present (consumed on use)
