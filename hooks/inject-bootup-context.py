SessionStart hook: inject dispatcher or subagent bootup files.

Fires on every SessionStart event. Reads the appropriate system bootup file
and user-specific bootup files, printing their contents to stdout.

Claude Code SessionStart hooks inject stdout as a system message at the start
of the session, making this content available before the first turn.

File injection order (dispatcher):
0. ADMIN_CHAT_ID preamble line (from ~/lobster-config/config.env, if present)
1. sys.dispatcher.bootup.md
2. ~/lobster-user-config/agents/user.base.bootup.md (if exists)
3. ~/lobster-user-config/agents/user.dispatcher.bootup.md (if exists)

File injection order (subagent):
1. sys.subagent.bootup.md
2. ~/lobster-user-config/agents/user.base.bootup.md (if exists)
3. ~/lobster-user-config/agents/user.subagent.bootup.md (if exists)

Dispatcher detection — two-signal approach (issues #1908, #2071):

Signal 1 — PID startup flag (issue #1908):
The launcher (claude-persistent.sh) writes the subshell PID to
~/lobster-workspace/data/dispatcher-startup-flag immediately before exec-ing
claude. This hook reads that flag:
  - Flag present AND PID alive (kill -0) → dispatcher session. Delete the flag.
  - Flag absent OR PID dead → not detected by this signal.

Signal 2 — UUID file match (issue #2071):
session_start(agent_type='dispatcher', claude_session_id=<uuid>) writes the
dispatcher's Claude session UUID to
~/lobster-workspace/data/dispatcher-claude-session-id. On each SessionStart,
this hook compares hook_input["session_id"] to the UUID in that file:
  - Match → dispatcher session (post-compact or resumed session).
  - No match / file absent → not detected by this signal.

Either signal firing → inject dispatcher bootup. Safe default (neither fires)
→ subagent path. The UUID file is NOT deleted after detection — it is written
once by session_start() and must persist across turns.

This two-signal approach handles:
  - Fresh starts (PID flag only, UUID file not yet written)
  - Post-compact sessions (PID flag consumed on first start, UUID file exists)
  - Both signals active simultaneously (no double-injection)

ADMIN_CHAT_ID injection (issue #1976):
For dispatcher sessions, this hook reads LOBSTER_ADMIN_CHAT_ID from
~/lobster-config/config.env and injects a one-line preamble:
  ADMIN_CHAT_ID=<value>
This eliminates the failed grep at every startup (the old doc referenced
~/lobster-config/lobster.conf which does not exist). If config.env is absent
or the key is missing, injection is silently skipped — bootup still proceeds.

# Bug: neither restart path reset this file when spawning a replacement

#   1. The graceful SIGTERM path (check_session_age(), fires at

#   2. The hard restart path (do_restart(), fires on RED heartbeat staleness)

# limit (2h), a new session could inherit an already near-stale heartbeat
# file from its predecessor and re-breach the cap within the very next 4-min
