SessionStart hook: on a fresh dispatcher restart, immediately mark all
"running" agent sessions as failed and ensure a compact-reminder is queued
if the catchup state is stale.

## When it fires

Registered under `SessionStart` with an empty matcher (fires on every
SessionStart). Filters itself to:

1. Sessions that inherit LOBSTER_MAIN_SESSION=1 (Lobster-managed sessions only).
2. The dispatcher session, not subagent sessions (detected via session_role).
3. Fresh restarts only — NOT context compaction events. Compaction is
   identified by checking whether ``on-compact.py`` recently updated
   ``compaction-state.json`` (within the last 60 seconds). On compaction,
   background subagents are still running; marking them failed would be wrong.

## Why this is needed

When Claude Code is killed and restarted (OOM, systemd restart, lobster stop),
every session in agent_sessions.db with status="running" is dead — the process
that owned them no longer exists. The normal reconciler applies the same
120-minute grace threshold regardless of whether a restart occurred, so dead
sessions linger for up to 2 hours before being garbage-collected.

A fresh restart is distinguishable from compaction because:
  - Fresh restart: new CC process, new session_id, previous dispatcher JSONL gone.
  - Compaction: same CC process, new session_id (compaction assigns a new one),
    but subagents are still alive in background Task() threads.

Running `agent-monitor.py --mark-failed` immediately at startup clears all
stale "running" sessions so monitoring is accurate from the moment the
dispatcher enters its main loop.

## Distinguishing restart from compact

On every compaction, ``on-compact.py`` atomically writes
``last_compaction_ts`` to ``~/lobster-workspace/data/compaction-state.json``.
We detect a compaction restart by checking whether that file was modified
within the last 60 seconds.  This is reliable regardless of whether Claude
Code populates ``hook_name`` in the SessionStart payload (it does not always
do so).  If the file is absent or older than 60 seconds, we treat the
SessionStart as a genuine fresh restart and run ``--mark-failed``.

## Stale-catchup compact-reminder injection

Issue #909: the dispatcher may exit after a compaction without spawning
compact-catchup (e.g. it reads the compact-reminder via check_inbox but then
exits before calling wait_for_messages again). On the next boot, the startup
protocol already always spawns compact-catchup, but only if the dispatcher
correctly follows the instructions.

To provide a code-level safety net: on fresh restart, if ``last_catchup_ts``
in compaction-state.json is more than STALE_CATCHUP_THRESHOLD_SECONDS old and
no compact-reminder is already queued in the inbox, this hook writes one.
This guarantees the dispatcher sees a compact-reminder in its WFM queue even
if the post-compaction compact-reminder was consumed without catchup running.

The injected message uses the same format as on-compact.py and sorts before
real user messages (ts_ms=1 rather than ts_ms=0, which is reserved for the
on-compact.py reminder).

## settings.json configuration

Add this to ~/.claude/settings.json under "hooks" → "SessionStart":

    {
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "python3 $HOME/lobster/hooks/on-fresh-start.py",
          "timeout": 30
        }
      ]
    }

Place this entry AFTER inject-bootup-context.py so the startup flag is
already consumed when this hook runs. (Both have empty matchers and will fire
on every SessionStart; ordering matters only for the startup flag dependency.)

    on every startup before the next one could be written), so last-writer-wins
