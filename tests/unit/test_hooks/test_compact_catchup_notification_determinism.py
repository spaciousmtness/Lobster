"""
Regression test: compaction recovery notification is sent deterministically by
the compact-catchup agent itself, not manually by the dispatcher (issue #1983).

Before this fix, the "🔄 Back online" notification was sent by the dispatcher
after it received compact-catchup's write_result, gated on LOBSTER_DEBUG. This
made the signal contingent on dispatcher behavior: if the dispatcher skipped
the step, crashed before reaching it, or mishandled the result, the
notification silently never fired -- while looking, when it did fire, like
confirmation that recovery succeeded. Issue #1983 calls this "epistemic rot":
a signal that fires "most of the time" is worse than no signal, because its
presence cannot be trusted and its absence is ambiguous.

The fix moves the notification into compact-catchup.md as a new Phase 5,
sent directly by the agent before write_result -- so it fires (or doesn't)
based on the agent's own completion, not on downstream dispatcher handling.

These are characterization tests over the agent instruction files (markdown,
not Python) -- the behavior lives in LLM-followed instructions, so the test
asserts on the structural presence/absence of the relevant instructions
rather than executing code. This mirrors the existing regression-guard
pattern in test_dispatcher_bootup_single_pass_read.py.
