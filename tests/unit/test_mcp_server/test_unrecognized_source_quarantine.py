"""
Tests for unrecognized inbox source quarantine (issue #1735).

An inbox file with an unrecognized source previously caused an infinite
wait_for_messages hot-loop: the file was detected on every call (glob found
it) but never dismissed (dispatcher couldn't route it). This exhausted the
150-turn limit in ~7 minutes and triggered repeated MCP restarts.

Fix: check_inbox quarantines files with unrecognized sources by moving them
to failed/ with _permanently_failed=True, so they cannot block the loop.

Behavior tested:
- Files with unrecognized sources are moved to failed/ and skipped
- Files with recognized sources are returned normally
- The quarantined file has _permanently_failed=True and _last_error set
- The quarantine does not affect messages with empty/missing source fields
  (those pass through so they can be handled by the dispatcher)
- bot-talk messages pass through without being quarantined
- The quarantine guard runs even when a source= filter is passed to check_inbox
