Smoke tests – Group A: hooks/on-compact.py

These tests verify the context-compaction hook works correctly.

Why these tests exist:
- A1: A syntax error in on-compact.py silently breaks all compaction flow.
  The hook is invoked by Claude Code's SessionStart event; if it crashes,
  the dispatcher never gets its re-orientation reminder after a context wipe.
- A2: If the compact-reminder message is not written to the inbox, the
  dispatcher will resume processing user messages with a blank context,
  not knowing it was just compacted. This is a silent correctness failure.
- A3: The health check reads compacted_at from lobster-state.json to suppress
  false-positive "stale inbox" restarts during the compaction pause window.
  If this field is missing or unparseable the health check will restart the
  dispatcher unnecessarily.
- A4: PR #237 fixed double-compaction. If the hook is run twice without an
  intervening wait_for_messages() call, there should still be exactly one
  compact-reminder in the inbox, not two. This is the regression test.
- A5: send_compaction_notify() must be called on every compaction, regardless
  of LOBSTER_DEBUG.  Previously the notification was gated on LOBSTER_DEBUG,
  causing 0 notifications in production and 2+ when health-check also alerted.
  This test pins the always-on behaviour.
