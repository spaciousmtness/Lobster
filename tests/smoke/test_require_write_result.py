"""
Smoke tests — Groups C1, C2, C3, C4: hooks/require-write-result.py

C1. No reminder is emitted when write_result was called during the session.
C2. A reminder IS emitted when a subagent session had tool calls but no write_result.
C3. No reminder is emitted for dispatcher sessions (identified by wait_for_messages).
C4. session_end is attempted with task_id from write_result AND with session_id.

Failure modes:
  C1 — if the hook fires spuriously for sessions that already called write_result,
       subagents receive a duplicate STOP message after completing work correctly.
  C2 — if the hook stays silent when write_result was skipped, the dispatcher
       blocks waiting for a result that never arrives.
  C3 — if the hook fires for the dispatcher, the main loop receives a spurious
       reminder on every compaction cycle, breaking the dispatcher's control flow.
  C4 — if the hook only uses session_id (UUID) for session_end, the "proper"
       hex-agentId DB row stays stuck at status=running forever (COMPLETED_NOT_UPDATED).
