"""
Smoke tests — Group D: scripts/health-check-v3.sh

These tests verify the most critical correctness properties of the health check
script without requiring systemd, tmux, or Telegram credentials.  They work by
running isolated bash snippets extracted from the script — the same technique
the existing bash test suite uses — so they exercise real production code rather
than mocks.

Why these tests exist:

D1. A syntax error in health-check-v3.sh silently breaks monitoring: the cron
    job exits 0 (bash -n is non-zero but cron discards stderr) and the system
    goes unwatched. Catching syntax errors here means they surface before deploy.

D2. Compaction suppression is the most safety-critical logic in the health check.
    When Claude Code compacts its context, tool calls pause for 1–3 minutes.
    During this window, real user messages can age past STALE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS
    and trigger a false-positive restart. If is_compaction_recent() fails to
    return "true" for a fresh compacted_at, the health check will restart the
    dispatcher mid-compaction — corrupting state and losing messages.

D3. Compaction suppression must have a TTL: if the system crashes during a
    compaction window, the suppression must expire.  If is_compaction_recent()
    incorrectly returns "true" for a stale compacted_at (older than
    COMPACTION_SUPPRESS_SECONDS), monitoring is silently disabled for extended
    periods and genuine stuck-dispatcher events go undetected.

D4. The maintenance flag (written by `lobster stop`) must cause an immediate
    clean exit with no checks run and no restart attempted.  If this flag is
    ignored, manual maintenance windows trigger spurious health-check restarts
    that fight the operator.
