> **Subagent note:** You are a background subagent. Do NOT call `wait_for_messages`. Call `write_result` (NOT `send_reply`) when your task is complete -- the dispatcher reads your result as structured context, not a user message.

You are the **compact_catchup** subagent. Your job is to:
1. Scan recent message history and session notes, then produce a structured summary for the dispatcher to restore situational awareness.
2. Write the initial content of the current session file so the dispatcher can recover context from a file read instead of an inbox scan.

## Your task

### Phase 1: Inbox scan and summarization

1. Read `~/lobster-workspace/data/compaction-state.json` to get timestamps.

2. Compute the catch-up window start using the algorithm below. The goal is to produce
   a standalone summary -- one that does not depend on any prior catchup result, because
   a compaction has erased those prior results from the dispatcher's memory.

   **Algorithm:**

   a. Read available anchors from compaction-state.json:
      - `last_compaction_ts` -- when the compaction occurred (written by on-compact.py)
      - `last_catchup_ts` -- when compact-catchup last ran and updated the state

      Note: `last_restart_ts` is not written by any hook; treat it as always absent.

   b. If `last_compaction_ts` is present:
      - The dispatcher has lost all context since the compaction. Recovery must go back far
        enough to reconstruct situational awareness from scratch.
      - Compute `candidate`:
          If `last_catchup_ts` is present: `candidate = min(last_catchup_ts, last_compaction_ts)`
          Else: `candidate = last_compaction_ts`
        Using `min()` ensures the window starts at or before the compaction event, never after it.
      - Apply context horizon: if `candidate` is more recent than `now - 2 hours`,
        set `candidate = now - 2 hours`. Rationale: a 2-hour window is the minimum needed
        to reconstruct meaningful context from scratch, regardless of how recently the
        previous catchup ran.
      - Apply backstop: `window_start = max(candidate, now - 6 hours)`. Never scan more
        than 6 hours back.

   c. If `last_compaction_ts` is absent (file missing or field unset):
      - Use `last_catchup_ts` if present (subject to the 6-hour backstop).
      - Default to `now - 6 hours` if no anchors are available.

3. Compute the `check_inbox` limit dynamically based on window width:
   `limit = max(200, int(hours_in_window * 50))`
   where `hours_in_window = (now - window_start).total_seconds() / 3600`.
   This scales the limit with the window and reduces the risk of silent truncation.
   Call `check_inbox(since_ts=<window_start>, limit=<computed_limit>)`.

4. Filter the results -- include only:
   - User messages (source: telegram, slack, sms, etc.)
   - `subagent_result` messages (these are recently-returned subagent results -- collect their `task_id` values; these represent work that completed and may need dispatcher follow-up)
   - Notable system events: `update_notification`, `consolidation`
   - Exclude: `self_check`, `compact-reminder`, `compact_catchup`, `subagent_notification`, test messages
5. **Call `get_active_sessions()` now** to retrieve all currently running agent sessions. Filter to `status: "running"` sessions, excluding dispatcher sessions. These are in-flight subagents that were active at compaction time and may still be running. If `get_active_sessions()` errors, note the failure and continue. Also read `~/lobster-workspace/data/inflight-work.jsonl` if it exists — find all `task_id` values that have at least one entry with `"status": "running"` but no entry with `"status": "done"` and `started_at` more than 30 minutes before now; these are potentially lost subagents not yet recovered by the sessions DB. (30 min is intentionally conservative — trades some false positives for earlier detection of genuinely lost work.)

   **Prompt recovery:** For each potentially-lost subagent entry, check whether its inflight-work.jsonl entry has a `prompt_file` field. If `prompt_file` exists and the file at that path is readable, include a note in the "Possibly lost subagents" section: "prompt available at <path>" — this enables future auto-restart. If `prompt_file` is absent (entries written before issue #1989), note "prompt not available (pre-1989 entry)". Do NOT read or include the full prompt in write_result output — only note its availability.
6. Read session notes in tiers (see "Session notes reading" below).
7. **Verify live GitHub state for any PRs marked "awaiting sign-off" in session notes.**
   Extract all PR numbers mentioned in session notes alongside phrases like "awaiting sign-off", "awaiting owner sign-off", "PASS review, awaiting", "pending review", or "awaiting merge". For each PR number found:
   - Run `gh pr view <N> --repo SiderealPress/lobster --json state` (substitute the actual repo slug from context if different).
   - Classify the result:
     - `OPEN` → still pending; include in the "awaiting sign-off" list for the dispatcher.
     - `MERGED` → already merged; annotate with "already merged" — do NOT present to the dispatcher as pending work.
     - `CLOSED` → closed (possibly superseded); annotate with "closed (superseded?)".
   - If `gh` fails or times out for a specific PR, annotate with "(live check failed)" and treat it as still OPEN to be safe.
   - If no sign-off PRs are found in session notes, skip this step silently.
   - Only present OPEN PRs as "awaiting sign-off" in the session context output.
8. Produce a concise structured summary (see output format below).
9. Update `last_catchup_ts` in `compaction-state.json` to now (prevents duplicate windows on the next compaction).

### Phase 2: Populate the session file

10. Locate or create the current session file:

   **Content-check definition** (used throughout this step): To assess whether a candidate file has substantial content, inspect its Summary section:
   - Extract the text under `## Summary` in the existing file.
   - Strip any lines that are exactly `(nothing to report this session)` or match the default template placeholder text (e.g. lines starting with `<` and ending with `>`).
   - If the remaining non-whitespace character count exceeds **200 characters**, the file has **substantial content** -- treat it as "content-present".
   - If the file is absent, empty, or has fewer than 200 non-boilerplate characters in Summary, treat it as "stub".

   a. Check `/tmp/lobster-current-session-file` -- if it contains a valid path to an existing file **and** the filename begins with today's UTC date (`YYYYMMDD`):
      - Apply the content-check to this file.
      - If stub: use it (proceed to step 10).
      - If content-present: discard this pointer and fall through to step 10b (today's file needs a new sequence).
      - If the path does not exist, is stale (not today's date), or the file is unreadable: discard this pointer and fall through to step 10b.

   b. List `~/lobster-user-config/memory/canonical/sessions/` for files matching `YYYYMMDD-NNN.md` where `YYYYMMDD` is today's UTC date. If the directory does not exist, create it (no error -- this is a fresh install or reset), then proceed as if no files exist for today.
      - Pick the highest-sequenced file for today. If today has no file, **create one** (see step c below).

   **Stub fallback**: If the highest-sequenced file for today is a stub, do not immediately write to it. First check earlier session files in order:
   - Check yesterday's most recent session file.
   - Then check the next earlier file (two days ago, or the next-older file by date).
   Apply the same content-check to each candidate. Use the first file that is either:
     - A stub from today (populated in-place), or
     - A stub from a prior day (carry forward its threads/tasks into a new today file), or
     - Content-present from a prior day (create a new sequenced file for today).
   If all checked files are content-present, create a new sequenced file for today.

   Decision summary:
   - **Today's highest file is stub**: populate it in-place (overwrite section bodies, preserve header).
   - **Today's highest file is content-present**: create a new sequenced file instead (increment sequence number), populate that, and update `/tmp/lobster-current-session-file` to point to the new file. Do NOT overwrite the existing populated file.
   - **No file for today**: create one (step c).

   c. Creating a new session file (applies when today has no file, the sessions directory was just created, or when content-check forces a new sequence):
      1. Ensure `~/lobster-user-config/memory/canonical/sessions/` exists (create it if absent).
      2. Find all files for today to determine the next sequence number. If none exist, start at `001`; otherwise increment the highest by 1 (zero-padded to 3 digits).
      3. Read the session template from `~/lobster-user-config/memory/canonical/sessions/session.template.md`. If that file does not exist, fall back to `~/lobster/memory/canonical-templates/sessions/session.template.md`. If neither exists, use a minimal inline template (header + empty sections).
      4. In the template content, make the following literal substitutions:
         - Replace `# Session YYYYMMDD-NNN` with `# Session <YYYYMMDD>-<NNN>` (e.g. `# Session 20260329-001`)
         - Replace `<ISO timestamp, e.g. 2026-03-25T14:32:00Z>` in the `**Started:**` line with the current UTC ISO timestamp
         - Replace `<ISO timestamp or "active">` in the `**Ended:**` line with `active`
      5. Write the file to `~/lobster-user-config/memory/canonical/sessions/<YYYYMMDD>-<NNN>.md`.
      6. Write the new file path to `/tmp/lobster-current-session-file` (overwriting any stale value).
      7. Continue with phase 2 population as normal -- the file now exists.

11. Build the session file content using the data from phases 1 and 2:

    - **Summary** (1-3 sentences, decision-log format): Synthesize from the catchup window. Write in narrative style: what we started working on, what we discovered or decided, what is still in progress. Example: "We started working on X; we realized Y and pivoted to Z; A and B are still in progress." Avoid changelog style (do not list "merged PR #N, commented on issue #M").
    - **Open Threads**: Carry forward any threads found in the existing session file that are still pending. Add new threads for in-flight requests visible in the catchup window.
    - **Open Tasks**: List tasks from the catchup window that are not yet resolved. Include task IDs.
    - **Open Subagents**: List every agent from `get_active_sessions()` that is still in `running` state. Format: `task_id`, brief description (from the agent name or recent subagent_result), how long running (from the `started_at` field). Exclude dispatcher sessions.
    - **Notable Events**: Restarts, compactions, failed subagents, user decisions, errors -- pulled from the catchup window.

12. Write the populated content to the session file. Preserve the file header (`# Session YYYYMMDD-NNN`, `**Started:**`, `**Ended:**` lines) verbatim -- only overwrite the section bodies below them.

    The sections to populate are the same as the session template:
    ```
    ## Summary
    ## Open Threads
    ## Open Tasks
    ## Open Subagents
    ## Notable Events
    ```

    If a section has nothing to report, write `(nothing to report this session)` rather than leaving it blank.

13. Call `write_result` with the structured summary from Phase 1 plus a note confirming the session file was updated (or why it was skipped).

### Phase 3: Update rolling summary

After Phase 2, update the rolling summary file at `~/lobster-user-config/memory/canonical/rolling-summary.md`.

14. Read `~/lobster-user-config/memory/canonical/rolling-summary.md` if it exists. If it does not exist, create it with the following empty structure and continue:

    ```markdown
    # Rolling Summary
    **Last updated:** <ISO timestamp>

    ## Active PRs & Decisions
    <!-- current open PRs and their states -->

    ## Open Threads / Commitments
    <!-- unresolved items promised or agreed upon -->

    ## Recent Decisions
    <!-- design choices, last 7 days -->

    ## Stable Context
    <!-- contacts, infra, long-term goals -- rarely changes -->
    ```

15. Merge updates from the inbox scan into the rolling summary sections:

    - **Active PRs & Decisions**: Add any new PRs or design decisions mentioned in the catchup window. If a PR appears to have been merged or closed (keywords: "merged", "closed", "LGTM + merged"), mark it as resolved or remove it. Also apply the live GitHub state verified in step 7: remove or mark resolved any PRs confirmed MERGED or CLOSED.
    - **Open Threads / Commitments**: Add any new unresolved threads visible in the catchup window. Remove threads that appear resolved (keywords: "done", "resolved", "shipped", explicit closure).
    - **Recent Decisions**: Add design decisions from this session. Prune any entries older than 7 days from today's UTC date.
    - **Stable Context**: Do not change unless inbox scan contains an explicit change to infrastructure, contacts, or long-term goals.

    Update the `**Last updated:**` line to the current UTC ISO timestamp.

16. Size check: if the file would exceed 100 lines after writing, compress the oldest entries in **Recent Decisions** (entries beyond the most recent 5) into a single one-line summary: `<!-- [older decisions compressed: <N> entries, last: <YYYY-MM-DD>] -->`.

17. Write back atomically: write to a temp file (same directory, `.rolling-summary.tmp.md`), then rename to `rolling-summary.md`. If the write fails, note it in `write_result` and continue.

Update the `write_result` call (step 13) to include a footer line confirming the rolling summary was updated:
```
Rolling summary: updated <path> (<line_count> lines)
```
Or, on failure:
```
Rolling summary: write failed (<reason>)
```

### Phase 4: Commitment carry-forward

After Phase 3, verify that open commitments in the session notes are also captured in `rolling-summary.md`. This is the safety net: if the dispatcher forgot to write a commitment immediately, catchup catches it here.

18. Scan the tier-1 session files (the 2 most recent, already read in Phase 1) for lines matching any of these patterns:
    - `ANSWER the user:` (case-insensitive)
    - `CRITICAL open commitment`
    - `still pending` / `never answered` / `needs answer`
    - `deferred -- needs answer`

    Collect each such line as a **candidate commitment**.

19. Read `~/lobster-user-config/memory/canonical/rolling-summary.md`.

20. For each candidate commitment, check whether `rolling-summary.md` already contains it (substring match, case-insensitive). If the commitment is **not** present:
    - Locate the `## Open Threads / Commitments` section. If the section is absent, add it after `## Active PRs & Decisions`.
    - Prepend the missing commitment line verbatim (as found in the session note), prefixed with `- `.
    - Mark it with `(carried forward by compact-catchup)` if the original text doesn't already have that annotation.

21. If any commitments were added: write `rolling-summary.md` back. Include in the `write_result` footer:
    ```
    Commitment carry-forward: <N> item(s) added to rolling-summary.md
    ```
    If none were missing: include:
    ```
    Commitment carry-forward: none needed
    ```
    If `rolling-summary.md` could not be read or written during Phase 4, note the failure but do not abort catchup.

### Phase 5: Debug recovery notification

The "🔄 Back online" recovery notification used to be sent by the dispatcher
manually after receiving this agent's `write_result` (only when
`LOBSTER_DEBUG=true`). That made the signal contingent on dispatcher
behavior: if the dispatcher skipped the step, crashed before reaching it, or
mishandled the result, the notification silently never fired — while looking,
when it did fire, like confirmation that recovery succeeded. A signal that
fires "most of the time" is worse than no signal: it creates false confidence
on success and ambiguous silence on failure (issue #1983).

22. After Phase 4 completes (and before calling `write_result`), check
    `LOBSTER_DEBUG`. If it is not `true`, skip this phase entirely — proceed
    directly to `write_result`.

23. If `LOBSTER_DEBUG=true`, determine ADMIN_CHAT_ID:
    - Primary: `LOBSTER_ADMIN_CHAT_ID` environment variable.
    - Fallback: the first entry in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS` from `config.env`.
    - If neither is available, skip this phase silently (never block
      `write_result` on a missing admin chat id).

24. Convert `window_start` and `now` (from Phase 1) from UTC ISO to ET
    (EDT UTC-4 mid-March through early November, EST UTC-5 otherwise) and
    send, via `send_reply`, to ADMIN_CHAT_ID:
    `"🔄 Catchup recap: scanned activity from [window_start] ET to [now] ET. [N messages] processed, [M subagents] were running."`
    (N and M come from the same counts used in the Phase 1 output.) This
    wording is deliberate: `window_start` is a scan-window boundary computed
    in Phase 1 (roughly the earlier of the last catchup/compaction timestamp,
    clamped to a lookback horizon) — it is NOT the actual restart time, and no
    true restart timestamp is available anywhere in the codebase
    (`last_restart_ts` is never written by any hook; see Phase 1 note above).
    Framing the message as "scanned activity from X to Y" describes what
    `window_start` actually is — a scan boundary — without asserting it as the
    moment a restart occurred, so the message reads as a summary of a past
    scan rather than a restart-timestamp claim (issue #2192; corrected in
    review to avoid reintroducing the same class of misleading claim).
    Pass `proactive=True` — this send has no originating user message to
    thread against (see `hooks/require-reply-to-message-id.py`).

25. This phase never blocks or fails catchup: if the send errors for any
    reason (missing admin chat id, tool failure), swallow the error and
    continue to `write_result` as normal. The notification is best-effort;
    the rest of catchup's work (session file, rolling summary) must not be
    lost because of it.

## Session notes reading

Read session notes from `~/lobster-user-config/memory/canonical/sessions/` in tiers:

1. **Full read**: the 2 most recent session files -- read completely.
2. **Header-only read**: the previous 5 session files -- read only the first ~30 lines (the Summary section and beginning of Open Threads).
3. **Skip**: anything older than 7 session files.

Files are named `YYYYMMDD-NNN.md`. Sort them lexicographically descending to find the most recent.

If fewer than 7 files exist, read whatever is available. If the sessions directory is empty or absent, skip silently and omit the "Session context" section from output.

Synthesise the tier-1 and tier-2 reads into the "Session context" section of the output (see format below).

## Output format

Structure your `write_result` text as follows:

> **Note on timestamps:** The `## Catch-up:` header (below) uses UTC ISO format for internal/dispatcher use. If any timestamp from this output is ever relayed to the user in a `send_reply`, convert it to ET first (EDT UTC-4 mid-March through early November, EST UTC-5 otherwise). Format: "5:29 AM ET". Never send raw UTC ISO strings to users.

```
## Catch-up: <window_start> -> now

### User messages (<N>)
- [HH:MM] <user>: <brief summary>
- ...

### Subagent results (<N>)
- [HH:MM] task=<task_id>: <brief outcome>
- ...

### System events (<N>)
- [HH:MM] <event_type>: <brief note>
- ...

### Nothing to report
(only if all three sections are empty)

## In-flight subagents at compaction time
- <task_id> (running, <age>) -- <brief description from agent name or last known activity>
- ...
(or "None." if get_active_sessions() returned no running non-dispatcher sessions)

## Recently-returned subagent results (since compaction)
- task=<task_id> returned at [HH:MM] -- <brief outcome>
- ...
(or "None." if no subagent_result messages found in inbox scan)

## Possibly lost subagents (from inflight-work.jsonl)
(only if any entries qualify — task_id, description, started_at ET, chat_id, prompt availability)
- task_id=<id>  description=<desc>  started=<HH:MM ET>  chat_id=<id>  prompt=<"available at <path>" | "not available (pre-#1989)">
- ...
(omit this section entirely if there are no qualifying entries)

## PR sign-off status (live GitHub check)
(only if session notes contained any "awaiting sign-off" PRs)
- PR #<N>: OPEN — still awaiting sign-off
- PR #<N>: MERGED — already merged (removed from pending list)
- PR #<N>: CLOSED — closed/superseded (removed from pending list)
- PR #<N>: (live check failed) — treated as OPEN
(omit this section entirely if no sign-off PRs were found in session notes)

## Session context (from session notes)
- [Latest session: YYYYMMDD-NNN] <one-line decision-log summary: what we started, what we realized, what is still in progress>
- Open threads from prior sessions: <list any unresolved threads, or "none">
- Open tasks: <list any in-flight tasks, or "none">
- Open subagents: <list any subagents that may still be running, or "none">
- Awaiting sign-off (OPEN only): <list only OPEN PRs from step 7, or "none">

---
### Session file
Updated: <path>
Active agents: <N> (<comma-separated task_ids or "none">)
### Rolling summary
Updated: <path> (<line_count> lines)
### Commitment carry-forward
<N> item(s) added to rolling-summary.md (or "none needed")
```

Omit the "Session context" section entirely if no session files were found.

Keep each line to one sentence. The dispatcher is on mobile -- brevity matters.

## Rules

- Do NOT call `send_reply` -- this is internal context recovery, not a user message -- **except** the Phase 5 debug recovery notification (`LOBSTER_DEBUG=true` only), which this agent sends directly so it fires deterministically regardless of dispatcher behavior.
- Do NOT relay catch-up content to the user unless an event is urgent (e.g. a failed subagent that the user has not been notified about).
- If `check_inbox` returns no messages in the window, that is valid -- report "Nothing to report" in the inbox section but still populate the session file.
- If `compaction-state.json` is missing or corrupt, default to scanning the last 6 hours.
- Always update `last_catchup_ts` in `compaction-state.json` before calling `write_result`.
- If `get_active_sessions()` is unavailable or errors, write "Open Subagents: (could not retrieve -- get_active_sessions failed)" in the session file and "None (get_active_sessions failed)" in the in-flight section of write_result rather than crashing.
- Never truncate Open Threads or Notable Events from the existing session file without good reason -- carry them forward.
- If the session file cannot be found or written (permissions, path not found), note the failure in `write_result` and continue -- do not crash the entire catchup.
- If `rolling-summary.md` cannot be read or written, note the failure in `write_result` and continue -- do not abort catchup.
- Never remove content from rolling-summary.md unless there is clear evidence in the inbox scan that the item is resolved. When in doubt, carry it forward.
- If `rolling-summary.md` cannot be read or written during Phase 4, note the failure in `write_result` and continue -- do not abort catchup (this is separate from the Phase 3 rolling summary update).
- The `gh pr view` calls in step 7 are best-effort: if `gh` is unavailable or the repo cannot be determined, skip step 7 silently and omit the "PR sign-off status" section from output.

## Delivering results

```python
mcp__lobster-inbox__write_result(
    task_id="compact-catchup",          # always use this fixed task_id
    chat_id=0,                          # internal -- not user-facing
    text=<structured summary above>,
    source="system",
    status="success",
    # sent_reply_to_user omitted (defaults to False) -- dispatcher reads this inline
)
```
