# Lobster Health Monitoring System

## Overview

The health monitoring system provides LLM-independent checks to detect and auto-recover from failures in the Lobster always-on Claude session.

## Components

### 1. Health Check Script (`scripts/health-check-v3.sh`)

Runs every 2 minutes via cron and performs deterministic, LLM-independent health checks:

| Check | What it detects | Action |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Systemd services | Service not active | Restart |
| Tmux session | Session not running | Restart |
| Claude process | Process crashed/missing (verified in tmux) | Restart |
| Inbox drain | Messages >5min old (RED) or >2min (YELLOW) | Restart / Monitor |
| Memory | >90% memory usage | Restart |
| Disk | >95% disk usage | Warning only |

### 2. Inbox Drain (Primary Health Signal)

v3 replaces the heartbeat system with a simpler, fully deterministic approach: **inbox drain monitoring**. If messages sit in the inbox longer than the stale threshold, it means Claude is not processing them -- regardless of the reason.

**Escalation ladder:**
- **GREEN** - All checks pass, inbox is draining normally
- **YELLOW** - Messages exist but are < 5 minutes old (monitoring)
- **RED** - Messages > 5 minutes old, or infrastructure failure -- triggers restart
- **BLACK** - 3 restart failures in 10-minute window -- alerts operator, stops retrying

### 3. Restart Rate Limiting

To prevent restart loops:
- Maximum 3 restart attempts per 10-minute window
- If exceeded (BLACK level), sends Telegram alert and stops retrying
- Manual intervention required after rate limit

### 4. Alerting (Direct Telegram)

v3 sends alerts directly via Telegram API (curl), bypassing the outbox and MCP server entirely. This ensures alerts work even when those subsystems are broken.

- Reads bot token and chat ID from `config/config.env`
- Sends alerts on successful recovery and on BLACK-level failures
- Falls back to log-only if Telegram credentials are unavailable

## Configuration

Edit `scripts/health-check-v3.sh` to adjust:

```bash
STALE_THRESHOLD_SECONDS=300          # 5 minutes - RED if any message older
YELLOW_THRESHOLD_SECONDS=120         # 2 minutes - YELLOW warning
MAX_RESTART_ATTEMPTS=3
RESTART_COOLDOWN_SECONDS=600         # 10 min window for counting attempts
MEMORY_THRESHOLD=90                  # percentage
DISK_THRESHOLD=95                    # percentage
```

## Cron Setup

The health check runs every 4 minutes:

```cron
*/4 * * * * $HOME/lobster/scripts/health-check-v3.sh
```

## Log Files

- `~/lobster-workspace/logs/health-check.log` - Health check results
- `~/lobster-workspace/logs/heartbeat.log` - Heartbeat status messages
- `~/lobster-workspace/logs/alerts.log` - Alert history
- `~/lobster-workspace/logs/health-restart-state-v3` - Restart rate limiting state

## Manual Commands

```bash
# Run health check manually
~/lobster/scripts/health-check-v3.sh

# Check current status
~/lobster/scripts/lobster-status.sh

# View recent health check logs
tail -50 ~/lobster-workspace/logs/health-check.log

# Touch heartbeat manually (for testing)
~/lobster/scripts/heartbeat.sh "Manual heartbeat"
```

## Failure Scenarios Handled

### API Errors / Claude Stuck
When Claude hits API errors or stops processing for any reason:
1. Messages accumulate in inbox without being drained
2. Health check detects stale messages (>5 minutes)
3. Automatic restart via `systemctl restart lobster-claude`

### Process Crash
If Claude process dies:
1. Health check detects missing Claude process (or process not in lobster tmux)
2. Automatic restart via systemd

### Service Down
If systemd service stops:
1. Health check detects `lobster-claude` or `lobster-router` not active
2. Automatic restart via systemd

### Disk Full
If disk usage exceeds 95%:
1. Warning logged (YELLOW level)
2. Does not auto-restart (restart won't help)
3. Needs manual cleanup

### Memory Exhaustion
If memory usage exceeds 90%:
1. Triggers restart (RED level) to reclaim memory
2. Consider adding swap or increasing instance size if recurring

## Improvements Over v2

| v2 (old) | v3 (current) |
|----------|--------------|
| Relied on heartbeat file (LLM-dependent) | Zero LLM dependency - inbox drain is the primary signal |
| Scraped tmux output to detect stuck state | Verifies Claude process ancestry in tmux (deterministic) |
| Manual tmux session rebuild on restart | Recovery via systemd (never manually rebuilds tmux) |
| Alerts via `scripts/alert.sh` | Direct Telegram alerts via curl (bypasses outbox/MCP) |
| 15-minute stale message threshold | 5-minute stale threshold with 2-minute YELLOW warning |
| 5-minute restart cooldown | 10-minute restart cooldown window |
| 7 checks (some LLM-dependent) | 6 checks, all fully deterministic |
| No disk space monitoring | Disk usage check with threshold |

## OOM Kill Monitor (`scripts/oom-monitor.py`)

Runs every 10 minutes via cron. Detects when the Linux OOM (Out-Of-Memory) killer
has terminated Lobster-related processes and alerts the operator via Telegram so
ghost subagents can be cleaned up.

### What it detects

Scans the kernel journal (`journalctl -k`) for lines matching:
- `Out of memory: Killed process <PID> (<name>)` — primary OOM kill confirmation
- `Out of memory: Kill process <PID> (<name>)` — newer kernel variant
- `Memory cgroup out of memory: Killed process <PID> (<name>)` — cgroup OOM kills
- `oom_reaper: reaped process <PID> (<name>)` — reaper confirmation

Processes watched: `claude`, `python`, `python3`, `node`, `lobster`, `uv`

### Deduplication

Each kill event is keyed by a stable hash of `(timestamp, pid)` and stored in
`~/lobster-workspace/data/oom-monitor-state.json`. A given kill event triggers
at most one alert regardless of how many times the monitor runs.

### Alert paths

Two alert paths run in parallel (belt-and-suspenders):

1. **Direct Telegram via curl** — works even if the Lobster process itself was killed,
   same approach as `health-check-v3.sh`.
2. **Inbox JSON drop** — writes to `~/messages/inbox/` so the dispatcher picks it up
   when it recovers and can relay context to the user.

### Cron setup

```cron
*/10 * * * * $HOME/lobster/scripts/oom-monitor.py --since-minutes 10
```

Or via the automated cron installer:

```bash
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/10 * * * * uv run $HOME/lobster/scripts/oom-monitor.py --since-minutes 10 # LOBSTER-OOM") | crontab -
```

### Manual test

```bash
# Dry-run: shows what would be alerted without sending anything
uv run ~/lobster/scripts/oom-monitor.py --dry-run --since-minutes 43200

# Scan the last 30 days for any historical OOM events
journalctl -k --since "30 days ago" | grep -i "out of memory\|killed process"
```

### Log file

`~/lobster-workspace/logs/oom-monitor.log`

## Improvements Over v1

| v1 (old) | v2 (replaced) |
|----------|---------------|
| Only checked file age in inbox | Multi-layered health checks |
| No heartbeat | Automatic heartbeat from MCP server |
| No rate limiting | Rate-limited restarts |
| No alerting | Alert system |
| Single check | 7 independent checks |
| No stuck detection | Detects Claude stuck at prompt |
