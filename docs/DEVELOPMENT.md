# Lobster Development Guide

This guide covers conventions for developing Lobster features using git worktrees, the standard workflow for all feature and fix branches.

## Worktree Workflow

All feature branch work happens in git worktrees placed at `~/lobster-workspace/projects/<branch-name>/`. The main repository at `~/lobster/` always stays on `main`.

### Creating a worktree

```bash
cd ~/lobster
git worktree add -b feature/my-feature ~/lobster-workspace/projects/my-feature main
```

Or, to check out an existing branch:

```bash
git worktree add ~/lobster-workspace/projects/my-feature feature/my-feature
```

Work inside the worktree directory. Commit and push from there. Open your editor pointing at the worktree path.

### Removing a worktree after merge

```bash
cd ~/lobster
git worktree remove ~/lobster-workspace/projects/my-feature
git branch -d feature/my-feature
```

## Convention 1: ~/lobster/ must stay on main

**Never run `git checkout <branch>` inside `~/lobster/`.** The dispatcher process reads configuration, hooks, and agent definitions from `~/lobster/` at runtime. Switching branches there changes what the live system sees and can break the running dispatcher in unpredictable ways.

All feature branch work uses worktrees at `~/lobster-workspace/projects/<branch>/`. This is not a preference — it is a system constraint.

If you need to verify which branch `~/lobster/` is on:

```bash
git -C ~/lobster branch --show-current
# Should always print: main
```

---

## Convention 2: The cp-then-test pattern

Hook scripts and agent definitions are referenced by **absolute path** in `~/.claude/settings.json`, which points into `~/lobster/hooks/` and `~/lobster/.claude/agents/`. A file that lives only in a worktree is **not** picked up at runtime — the live dispatcher never sees it.

To test a new or modified hook or agent definition before merging:

```bash
# For hook scripts:
cp ~/lobster-workspace/projects/<branch>/hooks/my-hook.py ~/lobster/hooks/my-hook.py

# For agent definitions:
cp ~/lobster-workspace/projects/<branch>/.claude/agents/my-agent.md ~/lobster/.claude/agents/my-agent.md
```

Test the live behavior. When you are satisfied:

- Do **not** revert the copy manually — the file will be correct in `~/lobster/` once the PR lands on main.
- If you need to abandon the test before merging, delete the copy from `~/lobster/hooks/` or `~/lobster/.claude/agents/`.

This pattern lets you run real traffic against a change without touching the main branch checkout.

---

## Convention 3: Register-after-merge rule

**Never update `~/.claude/settings.json` to register a hook before the hook file exists in `~/lobster/hooks/`** (i.e., before the PR is merged to main).

If `settings.json` references a hook path that does not exist on disk, every Claude tool call fails with a hook error. This can completely paralyze the dispatcher — no tools work, no messages are processed.

This is what caused the post-compact-enforcement incident.

### Correct sequence for adding a new hook

1. Develop the hook script in your worktree (`~/lobster-workspace/projects/<branch>/hooks/`)
2. (Optional) Copy to `~/lobster/hooks/` for live testing using the cp-then-test pattern above
3. Open a PR and get it reviewed
4. Merge the PR — the file now exists in `~/lobster/hooks/` via main
5. Only then: run `install.sh` to register the hook in `~/.claude/settings.json`, or rely on the idempotent registration block in `install.sh` if it already covers the hook

### Why this order matters

`install.sh` is designed to be idempotent and safe to re-run. It checks for existing entries before adding new ones. If your new hook is wired into `install.sh`, running it after merge is all you need. If you are registering manually, wait until after merge.

## Post-Update Checklist (VPS)

After pulling updates on the VPS (`git pull` + `uv pip install -e .`):

1. **Fix file permissions**: `chmod +x scripts/claude-persistent.sh`
   - `git pull` can change file modes (755→644), which silently breaks the tmux launch
   - Note: `claude-wrapper.sh` is superseded by `claude-persistent.sh` and no longer used
2. **Verify auth**: Test that Claude can authenticate — see `docs/REMOTE-AUTH.md`
3. **Restart services**: `systemctl restart lobster-claude && lobster restart`
4. **Verify startup**: `tail -f /home/lobster/lobster-workspace/logs/claude-persistent.log`
   - Should see `"Starting fresh session (attempt 1)..."` without immediate exit

## YAML Frontmatter in Subagent Prompts

The `auto-register-agent.py` PostToolUse hook reads structured metadata from subagent prompts using YAML frontmatter. New subagents should use this format instead of the legacy text pattern:

```yaml
---
task_id: my-task-123
chat_id: ADMIN_CHAT_ID_REDACTED
source: telegram
reply_to_message_id: 10924
---
```

The hook uses this to register the subagent in `agent_sessions.db` immediately upon spawn. Recognized fields: `task_id`, `chat_id`, `source`, `reply_to_message_id`.

Legacy format (still supported for backward compat): `Your task_id is: my-task-123`

See `hooks/auto-register-agent.py` for full details.
