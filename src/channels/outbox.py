"""
src/channels/outbox.py — OutboxFileHandler channel adapter (BIS-159 Slice 5).

Concrete ChannelAdapter implementation that writes reply dicts as JSON files
to a configurable outbox directory.  The file watcher process (bot/lobster_bot.py
or equivalent) picks them up and dispatches them to the correct transport.

This is the primary delivery mechanism for all channels: Telegram, WhatsApp,
SMS, Bisque relay, and Slack all read from a shared outbox directory (or
channel-specific subdirectories) and dispatch based on the source field.

Design:
  - Satisfies ChannelAdapter via structural subtyping (no explicit base class).
  - Uses atomic_write_json (write-to-temp + rename) so the watcher never sees
    a partial file.
  - Immutable after construction: the outbox_dir path is set at init time.
  - Thread-safe: atomic_write_json is re-entrant (each call creates its own
    tempfile in the same directory).

Extended (BIS-166 Slice 5+):
  - OutboxFileHandler also supports watchdog FileSystemEventHandler usage when
    constructed with source/send_fn/log kwargs (used by SMS, WhatsApp, Slack
    routers to dispatch replies from the shared outbox directory).
  - drain_outbox() processes any reply files already present at startup.
