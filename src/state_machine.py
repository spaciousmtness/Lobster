"""
dispatcher state machine — 5-state liveness file writer.

Prototype for issue #1918: replaces multi-file heartbeat approach with a
single dispatcher-state.json that encodes the dispatcher's semantic state.
This lets the health check apply per-state timeouts instead of one blunt
threshold for all situations.

States
------
STARTING    - SessionStart hook fired, before first wait_for_messages call
WAITING     - Dispatcher blocking in wait_for_messages (idle)
PROCESSING  - Dispatcher claimed a message via mark_processing (may be in long inference)
WINDING_DOWN - Context warning received, session ending gracefully
DEAD        - SessionStop fired (tombstone, triggers immediate restart)

File
----
~/lobster-workspace/data/dispatcher-state.json
{
    "state": "WAITING",
    "pid": 12345,
    "session_id": "...",
    "updated_at": "2026-05-02T12:58:00.000000+00:00",
    "since": "2026-05-02T12:57:55.000000+00:00"   # when this state was entered
}

Written atomically (write .tmp, os.replace) — safe to read concurrently.
Silent on all errors — must never interrupt a hook or dispatcher operation.
