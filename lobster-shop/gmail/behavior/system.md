## Gmail — Dual-Mode Behavior

This skill operates in two modes depending on whether the user has connected their Gmail account.

### How to detect which mode to use

Run this check (takes < 1 second, no network call):

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/lobster/src"))
from integrations.gmail.token_store import load_token

# MULTI-USER: always prefer chat_id from the incoming message context.
# Fall back to read_owner() only for single-user / legacy installs where
# the message doesn't carry a chat_id (e.g. scheduled jobs).
#
# In the Lobster dispatcher the message looks like:
#   message["chat_id"]  — Telegram chat_id of the user who sent the message
#
# Usage pattern (the subagent receives chat_id as a parameter):
#   USER_ID = message_chat_id or _fallback_to_owner()
def _fallback_to_owner() -> str:
    from mcp.user_model.owner import read_owner
    owner = read_owner()
    return owner.get("owner", {}).get("telegram_chat_id", "")

# Prefer caller's chat_id; fall back to owner for single-user installs.
# `message_chat_id` must be passed in from the dispatcher context.
USER_ID = str(message_chat_id) if message_chat_id else _fallback_to_owner()
token = load_token(USER_ID)
is_authenticated = token is not None
```

### Mode A: Unauthenticated (no token on disk)

Call `generate_consent_link("gmail")` to send the user a one-time consent URL.
If `generate_consent_link` raises, degrade gracefully with a user-friendly message.

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/lobster/src"))
from integrations.google_auth.consent import generate_consent_link
import logging

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

try:
    url = generate_consent_link("gmail")
    reply = (
        "To connect your Gmail, tap this link (expires in 30 minutes):\n"
        f"[Connect Gmail]({url})\n\n"
        "After connecting, I'll be able to read and search your emails.\n\n"
        "Note: Google may show an \"unverified app\" warning screen first — that's "
        "expected for this app right now, not a sign anything is wrong. Tap "
        "**Advanced**, then tap the \"Go to ... (unsafe)\" link near the bottom to continue."
    )
except Exception as exc:
    log.warning("generate_consent_link('gmail') failed: %s", exc)
    reply = (
        "I couldn't generate a Gmail connection link right now. "
        "Please try again in a few minutes, or check that LOBSTER_INSTANCE_URL "
        "and LOBSTER_INTERNAL_SECRET are set in config.env."
    )
    # Do NOT surface exc, env var names, or token values to the user.
```

---

### Mode B: Authenticated (token exists)

Read Gmail via the API. Always delegate to a background subagent — network calls
take longer than 7 seconds total.

```
send_reply(chat_id, "Checking your inbox...")
Task(prompt="...", subagent_type="general-purpose", run_in_background=true)
```

#### Reading recent emails ("check my email", "what emails do I have", "any new messages")

Subagent code pattern:

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/lobster/src"))
from integrations.gmail.client import get_recent_emails

# MULTI-USER: use the chat_id from the message that triggered this subagent.
# The dispatcher must pass it as a parameter when spawning the subagent.
# Fall back to read_owner() only for single-user / legacy installs.
def _get_user_id(message_chat_id=None) -> str:
    if message_chat_id:
        return str(message_chat_id)
    from mcp.user_model.owner import read_owner
    owner = read_owner()
    return owner.get("owner", {}).get("telegram_chat_id", "")

USER_ID = _get_user_id(message_chat_id)  # pass chat_id from dispatcher context

emails = get_recent_emails(user_id=USER_ID, max_results=5)
if not emails:
    reply = "No recent emails in your inbox, or Gmail is not connected."
else:
    lines = []
    for e in emails:
        date_str = e.date.strftime("%a %b %-d, %-I:%M %p UTC")
        subject = e.subject or "(no subject)"
        lines.append(f"- {date_str} | {e.sender}: {subject}")
    reply = f"Your {len(emails)} most recent emails:\n" + "\n".join(lines)
```

#### Searching emails ("find emails from X", "search for Y in my email")

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/lobster/src"))
from integrations.gmail.client import search_emails

# MULTI-USER: use the chat_id from the message that triggered this subagent.
def _get_user_id(message_chat_id=None) -> str:
    if message_chat_id:
        return str(message_chat_id)
    from mcp.user_model.owner import read_owner
    owner = read_owner()
    return owner.get("owner", {}).get("telegram_chat_id", "")

USER_ID = _get_user_id(message_chat_id)  # pass chat_id from dispatcher context

# query is the Gmail search string derived from user's message
emails = search_emails(user_id=USER_ID, query=query, max_results=5)
if not emails:
    reply = f"No emails found matching \"{query}\"."
else:
    lines = []
    for e in emails:
        date_str = e.date.strftime("%a %b %-d")
        subject = e.subject or "(no subject)"
        lines.append(f"- {date_str} | {e.sender}: {subject}")
    reply = f"Found {len(emails)} email(s) for \"{query}\":\n" + "\n".join(lines)
```

---

### Auth trigger ("connect my Gmail", "authenticate Gmail", "link Gmail account")

Respond immediately on the main thread — no subagent needed:

```python
import sys
import os
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.expanduser("~/lobster/src"))
from integrations.google_auth.consent import generate_consent_link
import logging

log = logging.getLogger(__name__)

try:
    url = generate_consent_link("gmail")
    reply = (
        "To connect your Gmail, tap this link (expires in 30 minutes):\n"
        f"[Connect Gmail]({url})\n\n"
        "After connecting, I'll be able to read and search your emails.\n\n"
        "Note: Google may show an \"unverified app\" warning screen first — that's "
        "expected for this app right now, not a sign anything is wrong. Tap "
        "**Advanced**, then tap the \"Go to ... (unsafe)\" link near the bottom to continue."
    )
except Exception as exc:
    log.warning("generate_consent_link('gmail') failed — degrading gracefully: %s", exc)
    reply = (
        "I couldn't generate a Gmail connection link right now. "
        "Please try again in a few minutes."
    )
```

### Natural language patterns to recognize

| Pattern | Intent |
|---------|--------|
| "check my email" / "any new emails" / "what's in my inbox" | Read recent emails |
| "find emails from [person]" / "search for [subject] in my email" | Search emails |
| "connect my Gmail" / "link Gmail" / "authenticate Gmail" | Auth flow |

---

### Graceful degradation

If `get_recent_emails` or `search_emails` returns an empty list (auth failure,
network error, empty inbox), tell the user nothing was found or Gmail is not
connected.  Never surface token values, error codes, or credentials in messages.

---

### Scope isolation

Gmail and Calendar OAuth flows are completely independent:
- Gmail tokens live in `~/messages/config/gmail-tokens/`
- Calendar tokens live in `~/messages/config/gcal-tokens/`
- Connecting Gmail never touches the Calendar token, and vice versa.
